\section{Virtual indoor mapping generation workflow}\label{workflow}

The 2.5D model of the built environment to interact with is generated offline and server-side, finally producing a HIJSON format.
Currently, we produce the HIJSON document from a python
script using two libraries for geometric computing (\texttt{pyplasm} and \texttt{larcc} \cite{Dicarlo:2014:TNL:2543138.2543294,paoluzziMS:2014,cadanda:2015}).

The modeling process will be improved by implementing a LAR-based 
graphical editor to assist the user during the description of the indoor
space. The realization of such an editor is already in our plans.

 The HIJSON  files are served on the web and transformed real-time client-side into the FIVE interactive interface (either 2D, or 3D or both) of the indoor mapping applications. The sequence of steps is outlined below:

1. \textit{Input of wire-frame drawings},
  starting from   raster \emph{images} of architectural floorplans of the building, interpreted into a simplified 2D vector representation (\texttt{.svg} files);

2. \textit{Generation of a 2D cellular complex}, via
  parsing of graphics elements from textual files, and automatic generation of a 2D cellular complex for topological computations and long-term storage of the model (\texttt{.lar} files) using a very simple and general geometric format (LAR) based on algebraic topology and linear algebra with compressed sparse matrices (see Appendix~\ref{sec:lar});

3. \textit{Structured 2.5D description}, produced by
  hierarchical modeling of cellular models, through automatic transformation of grouping elements of \texttt{.svg} files into a 2D description providing \emph{semantics} to spaces and  to the various elements of the building fabric (vertical or horizontal external envelope, internal partitions, horizontal floors, vertical communications), by using an object-oriented hierarchical description as a  \texttt{Struct} network;

4. \textit{Exporting to HIJSON file}.
The  structured and semantically annotated 2.5D building model is finally  exported as a rich textual description into \texttt{HIJSON} files, i.e.~in JSON format, though and intermediate \texttt{.yml} translation;

5. \textit{Client-based processing}
  The \texttt{.json} files are finally transformed client-side into 
  2D and/or 3D virtual environments, allowing the real-time spatial placement and
  user-tracing within the virtual environment of the individuals moving
  inside the real building (see Figures~\ref{fig:ward} and~\ref{fig:lab}).
